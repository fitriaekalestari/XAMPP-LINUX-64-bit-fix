This is the original Xampp file modified for 64-bit use of debian based OS.

To ensure success install 32-bit libraries if you have not already.
Type the following in the prompt :$ sudo apt-get install ia32-libs (without $ symbol)

Now copy and paste the lampp file from the download destination to your /opt/lampp folder.
The terminal line is:
$su
enter your password:
$sudo cp /home/"your user name"/Downloads/dring-1XAMPP-LINUX-64-bit-fix  /opt/lampp/
$

The file will be copied over and replace the existing lampp file.
